Intelligence - ability to acquire and apply knowledge

AI - develop systems for reasoning. Uses models built by ML to reason about world with intelligent behaviour

Deep Learning - continually analyze data with a complex logic structure and draw conclusions like human

Statistics - collecting, analyzing, presenting, interpreting data

ML - predicts with models learn with data without explicitly programmed. Builds models from data mining.

Data mining - uses statistics and other learning ways to discover knowledge in data.

Knowledge - patterns and deep learning acquired over time by human.

Wisdom = knowing how and where to use the knowledge.

Five number summary 
1. min
2. max
3. first quartile: 25th
4. second quartile
5. third quartile


quartile

c = P/100 * (n + 1)

first quartile 

Q1 = 25/100 * (8 + 1) = 2.25
cut point is between 2 and 3


---------- ------------------
Covariance & correlation measure relationship between continuous variables

Relationship - one attrib changes - what is influence on other
- positive relationship
- negative relationship

covariance - direction of var relationship (+infinite (+ve covar), -infinite(-ve covar))
correlation - direction & Strength of var rel (-1 to +1, 0 = no relation)
